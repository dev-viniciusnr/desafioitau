# Desafio Itaú - Backend Java

This repository contains the solution developed for a backend challenge proposed by Banco Itaú  
as part of the selection process for a **Junior Backend Developer (Java)** position.

The objective was to implement a RESTful API using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, following clean code practices and applying fundamental backend concepts such as data persistence, HTTP methods, validation, and proper use of response codes.

The challenge also aimed to evaluate skills in:
- Object-oriented design
- API structure and endpoints
- Java Spring Boot project organization
- Integration with databases

This project reflects my commitment to writing clear, functional, and well-structured backend applications in Java.
